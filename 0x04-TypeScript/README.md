# Tech Stack

- TypeScript – provides static typing and interfaces

- JavaScript (Vanilla) – DOM manipulation for rendering UI

- Webpack – module bundler and dev server

# What This Project Entails

- Using TypeScript interfaces to define structured data (Student).

- Creating and storing objects in an array (studentsList).

- Rendering that data dynamically in the browser as a table.

- Ensuring type safety with TypeScript while keeping rendering logic in Vanilla JS.
